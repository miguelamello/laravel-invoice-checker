# Recruitment Task üßë‚Äçüíªüë©‚Äçüíª

I will take the first section of readme to explain my approach to the task.


1) Required endpoints (routes).

I decided to create a set of minimal routes that gives the api user a better 
way to find correlated information about data. So the routes are:

Route::get('/invoice/list', [InvoiceController::class, 'list']);
Route::get('/invoice/list/{status}', [InvoiceController::class, 'listByStatus']);
Route::get('/invoice/{id}', [InvoiceController::class, 'getInvoice']);
Route::get('/invoice/approve/{id}', [InvoiceController::class, 'approve']);
Route::get('/invoice/reject/{id}', [InvoiceController::class, 'reject']);

Route::get('/company/list', [CompanyController::class, 'list']);
Route::get('/company/list/{name}', [CompanyController::class, 'listByName']);
Route::get('/company/{id}', [CompanyController::class, 'getCompany']);

Route::get('/product/list', [ProductController::class, 'list']);
Route::get('/product/list/{name}', [ProductController::class, 'listByName']);
Route::get('/product/{id}', [ProductController::class, 'getProduct']);

Note: Above routes are not protected by authentication. I would add a middleware to protect them. 
However it was not a explicit requirement in the task. On a real world scenario I would add a 
middleware to protect the routes and a authentication system. In my opinion the best approach 
would be to use a JWT token system or a OAuth2 system for a loose authentication. For a tight 
authentication with a more human approuch may be I would prefer an Multi Step process like emailing 
a token to the user. the proper approuch should be discussed with the team. 

2) Invoice Approval / Rejection

I was unable to find a complete Invoice Validation logic on the project sources. What I found 
was a kind 





### Invoice module with approve and reject system as a part of a bigger enterprise system. Approval module exists and you should use it. It is Backend task, no Frontend is needed.

- Invoice contains:
  - Invoice number
  - Invoice date
  - Due date
  - Company
    - Name 
    - Street Address
    - City
    - Zip code
    - Phone
  - Billed company

### TO DO:
Simple Invoice module which is approving or rejecting single invoice using information from existing approval module which tells if the given resource is approvable / rejectable. Only 3 endpoints are required:
```
  - Show Invoice data, like in the list above
  - Approve Invoice
  - Reject Invoice
```
* In this task you must save only invoices so don‚Äôt write repositories for every model/ entity.

* You should be able to approve or reject each invoice just once (if invoice is approved you cannot reject it and vice versa.

* You can assume that product quantity is integer and only currency is USD.

* Proper seeder is located in Invoice module and it‚Äôs named DatabaseSeeder

* In .env.example proper connection to database is established.

* Using proper DDD structure is preferred (with elements like entity, value object, repository, mapper / proxy, DTO) but not mandatory.
Unit tests in plus.

* Docker is in docker catalog and you need only do 
  ```
  ./start.sh
  ``` 
  to make everything work

  docker container is in docker folder. To connect with it just:
  ```
  docker compose exec workspace bash
  ```
